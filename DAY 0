✅ Tier-1 Patterns for Service-Based Companies
(LeetCode Problem Lists – Official Collections)
1️⃣ Arrays + Hash Maps

Problems where we use HashMap to track counts, indices, frequencies
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problem-list/hash-table/

2️⃣ Two Pointers

Used for sorted arrays, opposite ends, remove duplicates, etc.
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problem-list/two-pointers/

3️⃣ Fast & Slow Pointer (Linked List cycle type)

“Runner technique” used in cycle detection and mid finding
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problem-list/linked-list/

(Inside this list → apply filter “Easy + Medium” and pick cycle/middle related problems)

4️⃣ Sliding Window

Problems related to subarray/substrings window resizing
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problem-list/sliding-window/

5️⃣ Stacks & Queues

Next Greater Element, Valid Parentheses, Monotonic stack etc.
🔗 Stack → https://leetcode.com/problem-list/stack/

🔗 Queue → https://leetcode.com/problem-list/queue/

6️⃣ Modified Binary Search

Binary Search on answer / rotated array / peak mountain
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problem-list/binary-search/

7️⃣ Greedy Techniques

Best choice at each step → scheduling/interval problems
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problem-list/greedy/

8️⃣ Heaps (Top-K / Priority Queue)

Priority Queue / Heap based problems
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problem-list/heap-priority-queue/

9️⃣ Sorting

Custom sorting + two pointer mixing + frequency sort
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problem-list/sorting/

🔟 Merge Intervals

Super important for interviews ✅
🔗 https://leetcode.com/problem-list/intervals/
